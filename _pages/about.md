## Workshop description

Process mining has been successfully applied in analysing and improving processes based on event logs in all kinds of environments. **Responsible Process Mining** (RPM) is highly relevant to our more and more data-driven society and has received less focus. *FACT* (Fair, Accurate, Confidential, and Transparent) and similar other principles for data science and machine learning have been proposed (cf. [redasci.org](https://redasci.org)) to guide the development and application of data science. Issues such as lacking data quality in event logs, identifiable personal data in event logs, biased event logs, learning, discovery techniques with opaque parameters, uncertain event data and many more aspects threaten the compliance to these principles in process analytics. However, process mining could also be applied to help with the “FACT-ful” application of machine learning and other data-driven techniques by bringing transparency. All aspects of RPM are in the scope of this workshop covering a wide range of concepts and challenges such as *fairness*, *accuracy*, *confidentiality*, *privacy*, *transparency*, *explainability*, *trust*, *data quality*, *ethics*, *security*, and other related topics. Thus, responsibility in process mining covers a wide range of topics and issues. In the following, we briefly explain some of the main aspects.

**Ethics**. The field of ethics analyses practices, principles, traditions, and habits. Although widely disseminated as so, the primary interest in ethics is not to define what is “good” or “evil”, “right” or “wrong”. Ethics rationally analyses actions, with Morality as the subject. While Morality fits a subjective perception, considering that each of us is a subject endowed with morals, Ethics is traditionally taken as objective. It involves balancing subjectivity and objectivity, combining personal interest and moral interest. Since computational techniques, in general, are not neutral and, to a large extent, they are embargoed from technological determinisms; ethical analysis is necessary when applying process mining techniques. For example, predictive analytics results through process mining can lead to a behaviour that improves process performance but is not acceptable from an ethical perspective.

**Privacy**. Privacy relates to the concern that event logs may contain personal data of both customers and employees and the challenge of protecting the information about individuals while still being useful for process mining (e.g., differential privacy, k-anonymity, homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computing). Often, security aspects (e.g., encryption) are closely connected when processing personal data cannot be avoided. 

**Fairness**. Fairness in process mining relates to avoid making unfair decisions based on process mining results even if they are true based on the underlying data. For instance, a decision point in a process model can be equipped with a prediction model that learns from biased data and makes unfair predictions. Fairness concerns need to be addressed in a pre-processing phase, by altering the main algorithms, or in a post-processing phase. 

**Transparency**. Transparency has become one of the main concerns in data science. Particularly, in the field of deep learning where decisions are made based on complicated learning models. In that regard, process mining techniques can be used to provide transparency by explaining the details with a process model language. 

**Trust**. Trust is considered from two perspectives. First, the perspective of trust in organisational and technological measures that event logs are not misused (e.g., for worker surveillance) and the fairness of possibly automated decision taken. Second, from the perspective of trustworthy and transparent results of methods for process analytics, i.e., insights should faithfully reflect reality whereas data usually provides a biased viewpoint on it. This perspective includes aspects such as (the lack of) data quality, ensuring traceability and auditability (e.g., through blockchains). 

There exist interdependencies among different aspects of responsible process mining. For example, improving privacy always comes with data utility/quality loss, or providing confidentiality using encryption-based techniques may affect the transparency of results. Moreover, improving some issues such as trust often requires considering several aspects at the same time, e.g., security, privacy, and fairness. These interdependencies are challenging to address, yet, at the same time, they provide a big opportunity for collaboration among researchers to promote the responsibility in process mining as a whole. 

The main objective of the RPM workshop is to give a forum where researchers and practitioners can meet each other and start new collaboration points to promote responsible process analytics. We also consider topics from the ethics aspect to clarify real ethical issues for the process mining community with respect to the rules and regulations. We invite researchers and industry to share their research, ideas, experience reports, and challenges in this area.
